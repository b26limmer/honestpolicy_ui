1. Install all dependencies with `yarn`. (If you don't have yarn install it here: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

2. Start the server with `yarn start`. The develop command was modified to serve the page through your network. You can access through your cellphone just writing the IP adress given at the end.
